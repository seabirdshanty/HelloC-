## Hello C++

Basically my almost-first C++ program, compiled with MinGW on Windows.

Someday I'll make better programs, but for now, have this cute one :heart:

### `compile.bat`

If you have MinGW's g++ on you windows system you can use this to compile your own version of the program. `pico.rc` is used to change the icon.

I'm sure with linux the compile line is just `g++ 1.cpp -o hello.exe` since exes have no icons there.
